# Python Programming: Variables Explained!

Hi! Hope you're doing great! Today, we are diving into a fundamental building block of Python programming: **Variables**. Variables are essential for storing data that your program will use. Just like in the previous lesson, let's dive into our online compiler and explore how variables work in Python.

## What is a Variable?

In Python, a variable is essentially a name that refers to a value stored in memory. It acts as a reference to data so that you can use, manipulate, and manage data within your program.

## Variable Declaration and Assignment

In Python, you can create a variable and assign it a value using the equals sign =. Here is an example:


<CodeBlockComponent code='name = "Alice"
age = 5' language="python"/>

In this code, name is a variable that holds the string "Alice", and age is a variable that holds the number 5.

You can print the variables too! Use the print() function you learned in previous lessons, and remember you don't need to use quotation marks in print() function when using variables.

Press "Run" and we get the variable value printed.

## Variable Types

Variables can hold different types of data, like text (strings), numbers (integers, floats), and more.

```python
string_var = "Hello, World!"
int_var = 10
bool_var = True
float_var = 20.5

```

Each variable holds data of a different type: a string, an integer, a boolean, and a float, respectively.

We will study variable types more later!

## Variable Reference

Once a value is assigned to a variable, you can refer to that value by using the variable's name. This reference allows you to retrieve and manipulate the stored data.

```python
my_variable = 10
my_variable = my_variable + 5  
# The value of 'my_variable' is now 15.
```
Let us try it, set **my_variable** to any number, add any number to it and print it:

<CodeBlockComponent code='my_variable = 10
my_variable = my_variable + 5
print(my_variable) # should print 15' language="python"/>

## Reassigning Variables

You can change the value of a variable by simply assigning it a new value.

```python
message = "Hello"
message = "Goodbye"
```
The variable **message** holds the string "Goodbye" instead of "Hello". Try printing it!

## Variable Naming Rules

Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore, and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

```python
valid_var = "This is valid"
_invalid_var = "This is also valid"
```

- ### Avoid Using Reserved Words

Python has a set of reserved words that should not be used as variable names as they have special meanings. For example: if, else, while, for, etc.
- ### Avoid Confusing Names
Avoid names that are easily confusing like l (lowercase letter el), O (uppercase letter oh), or I (uppercase letter eye) as they can be confused with 1 (one) and 0 (zero).
- ### Avoid Using Special Symbols
Variable names cannot contain special symbols like @, $, %, etc., except for the underscore.
- ### Descriptive Naming
It's a good practice to use descriptive names for variables to make your code more readable.
```python
user_name = "Alice"  # Descriptive
u = "Alice"          # Not descriptive
```

Understanding these rules and the different types of data that variables can hold is fundamental to writing effective and error-free Python code.
## Dynamic Typing

Python is dynamically typed, which means you can change a variable’s type by assigning it a new value of a different type.

<CodeBlockComponent code='var = 10
var = "Now I am a string"
print(var)' language="python"/>

Try printing the **var** variable using the print() function and see if its changed!

## Task for Today! Using Variables

Once a variable has a value, you can use it in your code. So, your task for today is to create a program using variables, add your name and a greeting in a variable and print it out!

```python
greeting = "Hello, " 
# do add a space here to print out the space
name = "Bob"
full_greeting = greeting + name
print(full_greeting)  # Output: Hello, Bob

```

In this example, we’ve created a new variable **full_greeting** by concatenating greeting and name.

That concludes our exploration of variables in Python. Feel free to experiment with creating and using variables in your online compiler.
