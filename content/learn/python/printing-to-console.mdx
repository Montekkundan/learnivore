# Hi, Hope you're doing great!

In this lesson, we're diving straight into the world of **Python**, and our focus will be something so simple yet fundamental: printing to the console. Don't worry about installing anything; we'll be using an online compiler for this.

## What is a 'console' and a 'compiler'?

Before we move on, let's talk briefly about what a 'console' and a 'compiler' are, as these terms will frequently pop up in our learning journey.

- **Console**: It's like the command center for running code. When you run a Python program, the console displays the output, errors, and any other messages. Think of it as the screen where your code 'talks' to you.

- **Compiler**: A compiler is a program that translates your code into a language that your computer understands. It's like a magical translator between you and your machine.

For this lesson, we're using an online compiler, which lets you write, run, and test your code right in your web browser, without needing to set up anything on your computer. You can use any online python compiler, I'll share the link of which I'm using and others which you can use!

## Let's get started!

Alright, now that we have some basic understanding, let's get back to printing to the console. So open up your browser, and let's dive in!

The first thing you need to know is that the console is where we'll see our Python program's output. Printing to it is like saying, "Hey, show this piece of information right here." It's a key skill you'll use in every Python project you do.

**Time for action!** Open up your online compiler and type in the following:

<CodeBlockComponent code='print("Hello, Im a learner!")' language="python"/>


Then hit "Run." You'll see "Hello, Im a learner!" displayed on the console. Simple, right?

## Task

To take it a step further, imagine you want to keep a daily log of activities:

<CodeBlockComponent code='print("Morning: Wake up at 7:00 AM.")
print("Afternoon: Go for a run.")
print("Evening: Read a book.")' language="python"/>


Here's your challenge for today: Create your own daily log using the print() function. Once you've written it, hit "Run" to see your day planned out on the console.

Each print() command logs an activity. Change the text to log your day's activities.

That's it for today! Practice on your own. The sky's the limit!
