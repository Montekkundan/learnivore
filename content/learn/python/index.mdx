# Hi! Hope you're doing great!

Today we're talking about **Python**, which is like a toolbox for solving all kinds of problems on a computer. If you've never heard of it before, don't worry. It was created by a guy named Guido van Rossum a long time ago, back in 1991.

## What Can You Do With Python?

- Build your own website
- Sort and study numbers
- Teach the computer to recognize things like faces or voices
- Make your own video games
- Automate boring tasks, like sorting files

## Why Use Python?

1. **Ease of Learning**: Super easy to pick up, especially for beginners.
2. **Versatility**: Can do a multitude of different things.
3. **Extensive Libraries**: Lots of extra tools and helpers available for free.
4. **Community Support**: A large online community of Python users to help you out.

## Where To Learn More?

- Python official website
- Online courses
- Books for beginners
- YouTube tutorials

> **Note**: Python is used globally by companies like Google and Spotify to organizations like NASA. This means lots of job opportunities in various fields like software development, data science, AI, and more.

## Getting Started

If you're new and find Python to be a bit challenging, don't worry. Take your time to understand how it all works. To practice, you'll first need to install Python on your computer.




## Simple Example

I'll show you a simple example today to get you started.

We will look at the folder structure first!

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore # Git ignore file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md # README file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt # Project requirements
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py # Setup script
```

Here don't focus on other files as I will be explaining each file in other tutorials. For now, just focus on <code> **main.py** </code> file.



> **For people who are curious**: The <code> **main.py** </code> file is the entry point of our application. It is where everything starts and runs. We will be writing our code in this file.
The <code> **README.md** </code> file is for documentation purposes. It is a good practice to write a README file for your project. It helps other developers to understand your project and how to use it. 
The <code> **requirements.txt** </code> file is used to store all the dependencies of our project. We will be using this file to install all the dependencies of our project.
 The <code> **.gitignore file** </code> is used to ignore files and folders from git. We will be using this file to ignore the virtual environment folder.
