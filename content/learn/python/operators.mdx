Hi! Hope you're doing great! Welcome back to our channel. In today's lesson, we're going to explore a key part of Python programming – the Operators. By the end of this session, you'll not only understand these operators but also apply them in a fun project. So let's jump in!

Think of operators as the tools that let us do math, compare things, and make decisions in Python. We'll go through each type and see how they work with examples.

## Let's Start With Arithmetic Operators: Doing Math in Python

- **Addition (+):** Adds two numbers together.

<CodeBlockComponent code='a = 5
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Output: 8' language="python"/>


- **Subtraction (-):** Subtracts the second number from the first.

<CodeBlockComponent code='a = 5
b = 3
print(a - b)  # Output: 2' language="python"/>
- **Multiplication (*):** Multiplies two numbers.

<CodeBlockComponent code='a = 5
b = 3
print(a * b)  # Output: 15' language="python"/>
- **Division (/):** Divides the first number by the second.

<CodeBlockComponent code='a = 5
b = 3
print(a / b)  # Output: 1.666...' language="python"/>
- **Modulus (%):** Gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

<CodeBlockComponent code='a = 5
b = 3
print(a % b)  # Output: 2' language="python"/>
- **Exponentiation ():** Raises the first number to the power of the second.

<CodeBlockComponent code='a = 5
b = 3
print(a ** b)  # Output: 125' language="python"/>
- **Floor Division (//):** Divides and returns the largest whole number.

<CodeBlockComponent code='a = 5
b = 3
print(a // b)  # Output: 1' language="python"/>

## Comparison Operators: Comparing Values

- **Equal (==):** Checks if two values are equal.

<CodeBlockComponent code='a = 5
b = 3
print(a == b)  # Output: False' language="python"/>
- **Not equal (!=):** Checks if two values are not equal.

<CodeBlockComponent code='a = 5
b = 3
print(a != b)  # Output: True' language="python"/>
- **Greater than (>):** Checks if the first value is greater than the second.

<CodeBlockComponent code='a = 5
b = 3
print(a > b)  # Output: True' language="python"/>
- **Less than ( < ):** Checks if the first value is less than the second.

<CodeBlockComponent code='a = 5
b = 3
print(a < b)  # Output: False' language="python"/>
- **Greater than or equal to (>=):** Checks if the first value is greater than or equal to the second.

<CodeBlockComponent code='a = 5
b = 3
print(a >= b)  # Output: True' language="python"/>
- **Less than or equal to ( < = ):** Checks if the first value is less than or equal to the second.

<CodeBlockComponent code='a = 5
b = 3
print(a <= b)  # Output: False' language="python"/>

## Logical Operators: Making Decisions Based on Conditions

- **and:** Returns True if both statements are true.

<CodeBlockComponent code='a = 5
b = 3
print(a > 2 and b < 5)  # Output: True' language="python"/>
- **or:** Returns True if one of the statements is true.

<CodeBlockComponent code='a = 5
b = 3
print(a < 2 or b < 5)  # Output: True' language="python"/>
- **not:** Reverses the result, returns False if the result is true.

<CodeBlockComponent code='a = 5
b = 3
print(not(a < 2))  # Output: True' language="python"/>

## Other Operators: Bitwise, Assignment, Identity, and Membership

- **Bitwise Operators:** Operate on bits and perform bit by bit operations.
- **Assignment Operators:** Assign values to variables.
- **Identity Operators:** Check if two values are actually the same object.
- **Membership Operators:** Test if a sequence is presented in an object.

We will dive deeper on these later.

## Challenge

Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s put these operators to the test in a real-world scenario. Your challenge is to build a simple calculator. This calculator will perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

Now, you armed with this knowledge, try building that simple calculator! And remember, our community is always here to help.
