# Installation

The installation of Shadcn/ui is very simple. Just install it in your project with
cli command based on the project type.

For example if you are using Nextjs, you can install it with:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

You have option to install it with **yarn**, **pnpm** or **bun** too!

I usually use **npm** to install it, no particular reason, just a habit.

As I use Nextjs a lot so ill be using it as an example. If you have any doubt using
it with other frameworks, you can always ask in the [@Learnivore](https://discord.com/invite/8tFHup743H) discord server.

Just follow the installation process press enter to select the default options.

> **Note**: If you are using **src** folder in your project then for the question:

```bash
Where is your global CSS file? › › app/globals.css
```

You have to enter the path of your **src** folder manually like:

```bash
Where is your global CSS file? › › src/app/globals.css
```

otherwise it gives error and does not work.

Also I dont know whey but currently if you are using a typescript project the installer does not automatically know its a typescript project so if you want
for:

```bash
Where is your tailwind.config.js located? › tailwind.config.js
``` 

You can manually change it to **tailwind.config.ts** if you are using typescript.

It does not do any much difference but it just makes the project more clean.

> **Update**: With the December 2023 update of Shadcn/ui, support for custom Tailwind prefix and tailwind.config.ts has been added.

If you are using Astro, you can use the [Astro Shadcn/ui starter](https://astro.build/themes/details/shadcn-ui-template/)

**Create your own Shadcn/ui like project!**

You can also create your own Shadcn/ui like project! It is very easy to do so. Apparently Shadcn/ui uses monorepo, I didn't what it meant but I found out that it means that you can have multiple packages in one repo. So you can create your own Shadcn/ui like project by creating a monorepo and adding all the packages in it.
I tried creating a similar project by cloning shadcn/ui. It was a great learning experience if you create something like this and get stuck somewhere you can always ask in the [@Learnivore](https://discord.com/invite/8tFHup743H) discord server.

# Community

Well, it seems like the [Shadcn](https://twitter.com/shadcn) community is quite the lively bunch! People are always buzzing about it, and the creator, Shadcn, seems to be quite the social butterfly, reposting and sharing all sorts of content. It's like a digital beehive of activity!

Now, as for whether the community is good at responding to doubts and requests, it's a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, you have the helpful bees, buzzing around and offering assistance to those in need. On the other hand, you have the drones, just kind of hanging around and not really doing much. It's like a bee-utiful dance of cooperation and chaos!

In conclusion, the Shadcn community is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're gonna get. But hey, at least it's never boring!

Also if you have any installation issue or anything else you can always ask in the [@Learnivore](https://discord.com/invite/8tFHup743H) discord server. Ill be there to help you out!
